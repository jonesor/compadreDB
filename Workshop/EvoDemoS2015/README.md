#EvoDemoS 2015

Welcome to the workshop on the COMADRE and COMPADRE matrix datbases.

These databases together contain several thousand (mostly) published matrix population projection models for species from across the diverse tree of life.

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to the databases and explain their structure and how one can use them to obtain matrices from particular species of interest, and groups of species for comparative demographic analyses.

## Outline

- Introduction
- Structure of the database object(s)
- What metadata are included
- Querying the database
- Conducting a comparative phylogenetic analysis
- Linking to other databases (e.g. IUCN Red List)
- Do some analysis!

ROpenSci has some very useful R-based tools to link/query databases: https://ropensci.org

e.g. 

`rgbif` -	Access more than 400 million species occurrence records from across the globe in one place, from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility

`taxize` - Get taxonomic identifiers from many different databases; taxonomic synonyms; taxonomic hierarchies; retrieve common names, and more. Access to a dozen different sources

`rcrossref` - An R interface to Crossref metadata search API.
