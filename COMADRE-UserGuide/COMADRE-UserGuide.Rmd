# General Instructions

## Database Organization

The data associated with COMADRE are provided in a single R data object (extension .Rdata). In addition, these files are accompanied by R scripts and a nexus phylogeny available in the Supplementary Information of the manuscript introducing COMADRE, and in our github repository (https://github.com/jonesor/COMPADREDB)

* COMADRE_v_MAJOR_MINOR_PATCH.RData: Contains basic information regarding the source of publication, as well as ecological, biogeographic, and taxonomic details of the demographic study for each study species, the demographic information (i.e. the matrix population model) and metadata.

## The meanings of NA in COMADRE

NA in the COMADRE data generally means that the data are not available/applicable. This could be because the data were not reported by the author(s), or it could mean that the data have not yet been digitized for this version of COMADRE. It could also mean that the data are not applicable in this case (e.g. where data are derived from several geographic locations we do not report a single average latitude/longitude value) 


## Disclaimer 

The COMADRE digitization team does its best to ensure data accuracy, and every piece of information goes through multiple error-checks prior to its release in www.comadre-db.org. However, we claim no responsibility for any damage that may arise from using COMADRE.  A list of error checks and potential issues in the use and interpretation of the database are described in the main manuscript. The end user is ultimately responsible for his/her interpretations of the data.

### `MatrixStartYear`

**Definition:** First year of study. Year `t` in annual matrix population model that describes population dynamics from time `t` to `t+1`.

##### Possible values:

* `<yyyy>` -	e.g. 1994



-----------------------------------------------


### `MatrixStartSeason`

**Definition:** First season of study. Season `s` in periodic matrix population model that describes population dynamics from season `s` to `s+1`. Seasons are naturally hemisphere-specific, and this information can be deduced from variables `Country` and `LatDeg`, below. Here season is used as described in manuscript by the authors (summer in the southern hemisphere corresponds to Winter in the northern hemisphere).

##### Possible values:

* `1` -	Spring

* `2` -	Summer

* `3` -	Autumn/Fall

* `4` -	Winter


-----------------------------------------------


### `MatrixStartMonth`

**Definition:** First month of study.


##### Possible values:

* `<1-12>` -	e.g. 1 = January, 6= June etc.


-----------------------------------------------


### `MatrixEndYear`

**Definition:** Last year of study. Year `t+1` in matrix population model that describes population dynamics from time `t` to `t+1`.

##### Possible values:

* `<yyyy>` -	e.g. 1999



-----------------------------------------------


### `MatrixEndSeason`

**Definition:** Last season of study. Season s+1 in periodic matrix population model that describes population dynamics from season s to s+1. Here season is used as described in manuscript by the authors (Summer in the Southern Hemisphere corresponds to Winter in the Northern Hemisphere)

##### Possible values:

* `1` -	Spring

* `2` -	Summer

* `3` -	Autumn/Fall

* `4` -	Winter



-----------------------------------------------


### `MatrixEndMonth`

**Definition:** Last month of study.


##### Possible values:

* `<1-12>` -	e.g. 1 = January, 6= June etc.

-----------------------------------------------


### `MatrixSplit`

**Definition:** This indicates whether the MPM **A** matrix has been divided into its constituent **U**, **F** and **C** submatrices. See Figure 3 below for further details.

##### Possible values:

* `Divided` -	The matrix population model **A** has been been divided into the process-based submatrices **U**, **F** and **C**.

* `Indivisible` -	The matrix population model **A** has **not** been divided into the process-based sub-matrices **U**, **F** and **C** because insufficient information is available to classify the various demographic processes for each sub-matrix. In indivisible matrices, only **A** has values given - the other matrices are filled with **NA** values.

-----------------------------------------------


### `MatrixFec`

**Definition:** This records whether fecundity was measured at all for this matrix model.  

The rationale for this is that a fecundity (in the F matrix) may be recorded as 0 either because it was not measured, or because reproduction was measured and estimated to be zero. As a general rule, if any values for fecundity (e.g. in the F matrix) are non-zero, then MatrixFec should be recorded as 'Yes'. If all values are zero, then you we check the paper carefully to check whther this is because no fecundity was detected, or whether no attempt was made to measure fecundity.


##### Possible values:

* `Yes` -	Reproduction was included in the MPM, and thus values >0 should appear in the submatrix **F** if sexual reproduction occurred in these stages/ages. Note that it is possible that reproduction was measured and modelled but none occurred. In that case, values of 0 are possible in the F matrix.

* `No` -	Reproduction was not modelled by the matrix population model, either because it was not the goal of the study or due to logistical impossibility. In some **F** submatrices the elements where sexual reproduction would have appeared contain NA values, and in others they contain 0 values.

* NA - it is not known whether fecundity was measured for the matrix
-----------------------------------------------


### `Observation`

**Definition:**  This variable provides information that is not provided elsewhere but may nonetheless be important (e.g. "This is a matrix constructed from a long term dataset in the UK: size was estimated in a single season but female fecundity from a long term dataset")

##### Possible values:

* `<any text>` - any text string giving useful additional information.


-----------------------------------------------

### `MatrixDimension`

**Definition:** Dimension of the matrix population model **A**.

##### Possible values:

* `<integer>` -	e.g. 5

-----------------------------------------------

### `SurvivalIssue`

**Definition:** Minimum stage-specific survival value in the matrix population model submatrix **U** when > 1

##### Possible values:

* `<numeric>` -	e.g. 0.9, 1.2, 1.45

The object `matrixClass` is a `list` of `data.frame`s detailing the class names used in each MPM. 

### `MatrixClassAuthor`

**Definition:** The stage description as indicated in the source by the publication author of the matrix population model. When possible, we add units (e.g. cm, m, cm^2^).

-----------------------------------------------


### `MatrixClassOrganized`

**Definition:** We standardize all stages in a given population matrix model to one of three stages (prop, active, dorm) to facilitate analyses. 

##### Possible values:

* `prop` -	Propagule. This applies to every stage defined by the author as a spore-like stage. Users are encouraged to carefully examine matrices with these stages and to implement the appropriate calculations to avoid a spurious additional year being added when no additional gap-years exists in the study species, as explained by Caswell (2001, p. 60).

* `active` - This includes stages that can neither be placed in the  `prop` nor  `dorm` (see below) stages.

* `dorm` -	A stage that is dormant after having been born and established.


-----------------------------------------------


### `MatrixClassNumber`

**Definition:** A numerical representation of classes in the population matrix model. 

##### Possible values:

* `<integer>` -	e.g. `1,2,3, ... n`, where `n` is the dimension of the MPM (see `MatrixDimension` below)


-----------------------------------------------

# Variables in `mat` 

The object `mat` is a `list` of `list`s giving the actual MPMs in the form of the **A** matrix, and (where possible), the  **U**, **F** and **C** matrices.

**Description:** The matrix population model **A** which describes the population dynamics of a population under conditions described by `MatrixComposite`, `MatrixTreatment`, `MatrixStartYear`, `MatrixEndYear`, `Population`, and `Observation` in the `metadata` object.

-----------------------------------------------

### `matU`

**Description:** The population sub-matrix model **U** (a sub-matrix of **A**), which describes the survival-dependent dynamics of a population under the conditions described above. A range of numeric values are possible, but are constrained to be between 0 and 1. These include only survival-dependent vital rates (no sexual or clonal reproduction). The values are only digitized for `Divided` matrices (indicated by variable `MatrixSplit`)


-----------------------------------------------


### `matF`

**Description:** The population sub-matrix model **F** (a sub-matrix of **A**), which describes the sexual-reproduction dynamics of a population under the conditions described above. A range of numeric values are possible, but are constrained to be positive. These include only estimates of sexual reproduction (no clonal reproduction). 

The values are only digitized for `Divided` matrices (indicated by variable `MatrixSplit`)

-----------------------------------------------


### `matC`

**Description:** The population sub-matrix model **C** (a sub-matrix of **A**), which describes the clonal-reproduction dynamics of a population under the conditions described above. A range of numeric values are possible, but these are constrained to be positive. These include only estimates of clonal reproduction. 

The values are only digitized for `Divided` matrices (indicated by variable `MatrixSplit`)

# Appendix - The calculation of mean matrix population models

*	In COMADRE we present the individual matrix population models for each season, year, study population and treatment that can be calculated from a paper, as well as those personally communicated by the publication authors to the COMADRE digitization team.  When pertinent, mean matrix population models that are element-by-element averages (arithmetic mean) across all Unmanipulated matrix population models (defined above) and across each treatment group are also given. Mean matrix population models that combine estimates from different treatments, or that combine estimates from treatments with unmanipulated conditions, are not calculated because of their lack of biological interpretation (Figure 2).

*	Seasonal matrix population models, where more than one matrix  population model exists for a single year, are marked as “Seasonal”.  For these, we calculate average matrix population models for each season but not for each year (Figure 3). Deriving an annual model from  seasonal data is straightforward and the calculations are described by Caswell (2001, p. 349).

-----------------------------------------------

![mean matrices](images/Fig2.png)

**Figure 2.** *Schematic showing how mean population matrix models are derived from all available population matrix models in a study.* **A.** *For annual population matrix models (those that follow population dynamics from one year to the next, or sometimes more – some tree species are studied with a 5-year interval), element-by-element means are first calculated across the population matrix models describing the population dynamics for time periods within each population. Then the grand element-by-element mean is calculated across the matrix population models for the different populations. This procedure is repeated for models describing dynamics under each imposed treatment (pink matrices below) and for those describing the dynamics of unmanipulated populations (gray). Note that mean population matrix models are only calculated from population matrix models that share the same treatment (or absence of treatment).* **B.** *For seasonal or periodic population matrix models (e.g. for annual species), the mean seasonal population matrix model is calculated within populations and then across populations, both for matrices describing treated populations and for those describing populations with no imposed treatment (i.e. unmanipulated).*






![A life cycle](images/Fig3.png)
**Figure 3.** *Life cycle of two hypothetical animal populations based on age* (**A**) *and size* (**B**)*, with their corresponding matrix population models A, and underlying basic demographic processes of survival (U sub-matrix; solid arrows), sexual reproduction (F sub-matrix; dashed arrows) and clonal reproduction (C sub-matrix; dotted arrows). In the Leslie matrix model example* (**A**) *, the division of sub-matrices is more straightforward than in the Lefkovitch matrix model example * (**B**)*. In the latter imaginary example, individuals can transition into the same stage as they can contribute with sexual and/or clonal offspring (e.g. small stage). In these cases, splitting A into sub-matrices U, F and C is only feasible when sufficient information is provided by the authors (see variable `MatrixSplit` in above). *
